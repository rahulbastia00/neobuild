-	Create and deploy a mini backend using Node JS frameworks like  Express JS / Nest JS for a fictional resume analysis app 
-	Use MongoDB (cloud version) as non-relational database for storing/retrieving data – use free tier plan
- Use Google Gemini for LLM APIs - use free tier plan
- Use Vercel/Render/Railway for deploying APIs on cloud - use free tier  
-	The backend will consist of 3 RESTful APIs :

#1. Authentication API - Authenticate the user & authorise service via Java Web Token
* Use hard-coded credential {"username" : "naval.ravikant", "password" : "05111974"} to authenticate the user
*	Receive JSON in req body {"username" : <username>, "password" : <password>} and check if authentication is valid as per above credential
* If successful return status code 200 and unique JWT in res body of API as JSON {"JWT": <JWT>} to authorize user for future APIs
* If unsuccessful return appropriate error message in res body {"error":<error>}

#2. Resume data enrichment API - extract text data from PDF file URL & store information in cloud database
*	Receive JSON in req body {"url":<url>} with JWT passed in Authorization header and check if JWT is valid or not
* If JWT is invalid => return status code 401 
* If JWT is valid => Use pdf-text library (npm packages are available) to extract text from given URL of PDF file
* If no text data is detected in the file/another file type is passed apart from PDF => return status code 500
* Pass the extracted raw text to LLM API response body and write a prompt to package the data into following JSON format and create a new record in "applicant" collection (data model in attached Miro diagram) in MongoDB and return status code 200 :
{
  "name": <name>,
  "email": <email>,
  "education":
    {
      "degree": <degree>,
      "branch" : <branch>,
      "institution": <institution>,
      "year": <year>
    },
  "experience": 
    {
      "job_title": <job_title>,
      "company": <company>,
      "start_date": <start_date>,
      "end_date": <end_date>
    },
  "skills": [
    <skill_1>,
    <skill_2>,
    ...
  ],
  "summary" <write a short summary about the candidate profile - generated by LLM based on resume data >
}

#3. Resume search API - search for resume information in database based on name query
*	Receive JSON in req body {"name":<name>} with JWT passed in Authorization header and check if JWT is valid or not
* If JWT is invalid => return status code 401 
* Search the database for matching record with parameter "name" => If no such name exists in database - return status code 404
* Return the list of matching records in JSON format in response body with status code 200 (The search should not be case sensitive & token-agnostic Ex: If search_token is ‘raj’ , then API should return [{name : Raj Singh …},{name : Vanraj Mehta …} , {name : Prem Raj …}]) 

-	Make separate routes for each API to easily distinguish between them
-	Include relevant headers/other fields in payload and structure res & req body clearly
-	Encrypt data like name & email etc while including them in API payload – decrypt on server side (can use any algorithm of choice)
- Use the dummy resume PDF URL for testing https://www.dhli.in/uploaded_files/resumes/resume_3404.pdf
- Hide your Gemini API key in ENV variable in deployment environment
- Test your APIs via Postman console before submitting (same will be used for final assessment)
-	Send via mail the deployed project link OR share Postman API collection + Github repo link by 3 days from getting the assignment.You can extend the time of submission by 1-2 days by informing prior
-	You can reach out to Ayush Soni via direct message any time or additionally (ayush.soni@neobuild.tech or +91 9307576314 ) to clear any doubts, ask for clarifications & get guidance (additional documentation) on the assignment
