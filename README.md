It looks like your project is a **Resume Analyzer** using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT authentication, encryption, and the Google Generative AI API. You're also using PDF parsing and secure handling of sensitive data like names and emails.

Here are a few suggestions to enhance your project:

### ‚úÖ **Improvements & Features to Add:**
1. **Error Handling Middleware:**
   - Add a global error-handling middleware to catch unexpected errors.
   
2. **Validation:**
   - Use libraries like `Joi` or `express-validator` to validate request payloads (e.g., for `login` or `enrichResume`).

3. **Logging:**
   - Implement a logging library like `winston` for structured logs instead of `console.log`.

4. **Pagination for Search Results:**
   - Add pagination for `/api/search/name` endpoint if you expect a large number of applicants.

5. **Rate Limiting & Security:**
   - Use `express-rate-limit` and `helmet` for added security, especially for public routes like login.

### üîê **Security Recommendations:**
- Avoid hardcoding credentials (`VALID_CREDENTIALS` in `authController.js`). Instead, use environment variables.
- Store JWT secrets and encryption keys securely using environment variables, and consider rotating keys periodically.

### üöÄ **Deployment Steps (Using Render):**
1. Make sure your `render.yaml` file is correctly configured for deploying your app.
2. Set the environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`) securely in Render's dashboard.
3. Connect your GitHub repository to Render and deploy.

Would you like help with adding any of these features or configuring the deployment steps?
